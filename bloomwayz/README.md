### Written by Junyoung

Welcome to [Junyoung](https://github.com/bloomwayz)'s folder!

## Documents
These documents are created via [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst). \
I uploaded my PDF files as well, so that the readers can easily read the documents. \
Good luck!ðŸ¤ž

## Requirements
(It can be ignored unless you are interested in the typesetting.) \
If you compile the Typst codes, please make sure that the followings are ready before compiling.
- [Syntree](https://github.com/bloomwayz/typst-syntree) library
  - _Syntree_ library allows us to draw syntax trees via Typst.
  - Plus, my _Syntree_ library provides "Do not line!" feature.
- Fonts (can be downloaded in [KOPUS](https://www.kopus.org/biz-electronic-font2/))
  - Title: KoPubWorld Dotum Pro (Bold, Medium)
  - Paragraph: KoPubWorld Batang Pro (Bold, Light)

If you work in your local environment, the additional fonts should be installed. [Online compiler](https://typst.app) users can ignore this.
